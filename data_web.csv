The MEng courses differ from the BEng by offering the opportunity to study topics in more detail with the option to study a modern language.
You can choose whether to take a placement year. The MEng course takes four years to complete, or five years with a placement year, while the BEng takes three years, or four years with a placement. The placement is normally taken after the second year, but MEng students can opt to take it after the third year.
It is possible to transfer from a BEng to an MEng up to the end of the second year, providing that the transfer progression criteria have been met.

Chemical Engineering BEng (Hons),Chemical Engineering is the study of converting one thing to another in some of the most essential processes in our lives. It makes a vital contribution to the sustainability of modern society. Graduates will be in high demand and will have the opportunity to help change the world.,https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/chemical-engineering-beng/,Undergraduate study,"Chemical Engineering is a highly adaptable and versatile area of engineering, which applies the principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to transform energy and materials into useful and affordable products. It covers the research, design and operation of new and existing processes to minimise environmental impacts, ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards and maximise profits and benefits to society.
Research suggests an expected shortfall in skilled chemical engineers to support the UK’s green recovery and net-zero targets, which means chemical engineers will be highly sought after for the specialist work required.
Chemical engineers take leading roles in many different sectors, ranging from energy and water, food, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, to consumer products, and even finance. They use their technical know-how and ingenuity to develop solutions to many of the world’s most pressing challenges, including climate change and the large-scale production of new vaccines.
At Loughborough, we conduct world-leading research to drive the sustainable revolution, in areas such as low-carbon technologies, next-generation healthcare or advanced manufacturing. An example is our new National Centre for the Circular Chemical Economy, which seeks to transform the UK chemical sector to eliminate waste and reliance on fossil technologies. Our research directly informs our teaching and project work, ensuring our students are fully equipped to meet 21st century challenges.
Our Chemical Engineering degrees teach students how to apply scientific and engineering principles to the design and analysis of chemical process equipment and flow sheets. Bench and pilot-scale laboratories, VR simulation, computer classes and project work help students to understand and apply taught principles to engineering problems, whilst also developing key laboratory, teamwork and IT skills.
We offer a number of options during the degree. These include language options in years one and two (at different levels) in either French, German, Spanish or Mandarin, as an alternative to Materials Processing and Food Engineering. Our students can then choose up to three optional modules in their final year including management, environmental, IT, bioprocessing and healthcare topics. During the final design project, students work both in teams and individually to conceptualise and design an industrial plant to address a specified design challenge, usually aligned with their module choices and research strengths of the department. The project brings together all aspects of the degree, including initial technology selection and flowsheet development, detailed design of individual unit operation, process optimisation, safety and operability analysis and finally full economic and environmental evaluation.
What is the difference between MEng and BEng?
The three years of the BEng degree and the first three years of the MEng degree are identical, with a good mix of theory, application and practical content from day one. The additional year of the MEng programme allows students to study a wider range of technical subjects with additional depth, as well as undertaking the Professional Development Project (PDP), which can be undertaken in industry, abroad or at Loughborough. Whilst both the MEng and BEng are accredited by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), only the MEng degree fully meets all educational requirements for Chartered Engineer status.

It makes a vital contribution to the sustainability of modern society. Graduates will be in high demand and will have the opportunity to help change the world.,https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/chemical-engineering-meng/,Undergraduate study,"Chemical Engineering is a highly adaptable and versatile area of engineering, which applies the principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to transform energy and materials into useful and affordable products. It covers the research, design and operation of new and existing processes, to minimise environmental impacts, ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards and maximise profits and benefits to society.
The 2020 annual skills survey for UK engineering employers highlighted an expected shortfall in skilled chemical engineers to support the UK’s green recovery and net-zero targets, which means chemical engineers will be highly sought after for the specialist work required.
Chemical engineers take leading roles in many different sectors, ranging from energy and water, food, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, to consumer products, and even finance. They use their technical know-how and ingenuity to develop solutions to many of the world’s most pressing challenges, including climate change and the large-scale production of new vaccines.
At Loughborough, we conduct world-leading research to drive the sustainable revolution, in areas such as low-carbon technologies, next generation healthcare or advanced manufacturing. An example is our new National Centre for the Circular Chemical Economy, which seeks to transform the UK chemical sector to eliminate waste and reliance on fossil technologies. Our research directly informs our teaching and project work, ensuring our students are fully equipped to meet 21st century challenges.
Our Chemical Engineering degrees teach students how to apply scientific and engineering principles to the design and analysis of chemical process equipment and flow sheets. Bench and pilot-scale laboratories, VR simulation, computer classes and project work help students to understand and apply taught principles to engineering problems, whilst also developing key laboratory, teamwork and IT skills.
We offer a number of options during the degree. These include language options in years one and two (at different levels) in either French, German, Spanish or Mandarin, as an alternative to Materials Processing and Food Engineering. Our students can then choose up to three optional modules in their third year including management, environmental, IT, bioprocessing and healthcare topics, and four options in Year 4 for more in-depth focus on aspects of the degree or expanding their knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. During the final design project, students work both in teams and individually to conceptualise and design an industrial plant to address a specified design challenge, usually aligned with their module choices and research strengths of the department. The project brings together all aspects of the degree, including initial technology selection and flowsheet development, detailed design of individual unit operation, process optimisation, safety and operability analysis and finally full economic and environmental evaluation.
During the MEng degree, you will also complete a Professional Development Project (PDP), where you can join a research group at Loughborough, in industry or abroad, to develop new knowledge in science or engineering. The PDP is an excellent opportunity to gain first-hand insight into our ground-breaking research, whilst acquiring key transferable skills, such as project planning, reporting and data analysis. Recent projects have ranged from electrochemical harvesting of CO2 for renewable chemical production, the development of microfluidic manufacturing devices, or the application of artificial neural networks to predict material behaviour.
What is the difference between MEng and BEng?
The three years of the BEng degree and the first three years of the MEng degree are identical, with a good mix of theory, application and practical content from day one. The additional year of the MEng programme allows students to study a wider range of technical subjects with additional depth, as well as undertaking the Professional Development Project (PDP), which can be undertaken in industry, abroad or at Loughborough. Whilst both the MEng and BEng are accredited by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), only the MEng degree fully meets all educational requirements for Chartered Engineer status.

We need to change how our cities are planned and developed to tackle these economic, social and environmental challenges.
Our Urban Planning course draws on our diverse expertise, providing you with the skills required to help you shape our future and solve the big issues our society faces. This course has been specifically developed with leading planning practitioners to equip you with the latest skills and knowledge needed for a future in Urban Planning. A key feature of our course is the focus on developing your digital and data skills needed for planning smart cities, which are highly attractive to graduate employers. These new digital and data skills will provide us with new ways to understand, plan and adapt our cities.
The course incorporates practical and hands-on experiences, such as live case studies, in many aspects of urban planning and design, helping you link theory to practice. It examines ways in which our cities and urban environments have historically developed and been designed, whilst challenging you to propose visions of the future in order to make our cities healthier, more vibrant, sustainable and safer. You will focus on the role and potential of the planning profession to manage technological change in cities and exploit the potential of smart cities to enhance our urban environments.
Urban Planning is a multidisciplinary subject. You will benefit from studying in the School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering, providing an integrated and holistic approach. As such, you will gain invaluable practical experience of working in interdisciplinary teams with Architecture, Civil and Architectural Engineering, Commercial Management and Quantity Surveying, and Construction Engineering Management students, giving you a unique insight into the role of planners in development projects, thereby simulating your potential future career. In addition, the course draws from the expertise of leading academics from across the School and University, particularly Geography and Environment.
Throughout the Urban Planning course, our students normally undertake several field trips each year. Field trips are an exciting and invaluable learning experience as they provide unique insight and opportunity to explore planning in the real world. All field trips, which are incorporated within modules, are included within your tuition fee.
